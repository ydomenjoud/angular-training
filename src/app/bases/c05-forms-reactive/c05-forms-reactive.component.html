<h1>Reactive forms</h1>

<h2>formControl</h2>
<form >

  <div>
    EMAIL: <input name="email" [formControl]="emailControl">
    {{ emailControl.value }}
  </div>
  <div>
    PASSWORD: <input name="login" [formControl]="passwordControl" type="password">
    {{ passwordControl.value }}
  </div>

</form>

<h2>formGroup &amp; formControlName</h2>
<button (click)="setValidEmail()">Set valid email</button>
<form [formGroup]="authForm" [ngClass]="{invalid: authForm.invalid}">
  status {{ authForm.status }}
  <div>
    EMAIL (@google.fr): <input name="email" formControlName="email">
  </div>
  <div>
    PASSWORD: <input name="login" formControlName="password" type="password">
  </div>


</form>


<h2>Async vs. sync</h2>
<p>Reactive forms are synchronous, and template-driven forms are asynchronous.</p>

<p>In reactive forms, you create the entire form control tree in code. You can immediately update a value or drill down through the descendants of the parent form because all controls are always available.</p>

<p>Template-driven forms delegate the creation of their form controls to directives. To avoid changed after checked errors, these directives take more than one cycle to build the entire control tree. That means you must wait until the next change detection cycle happens before manipulating any of the controls from within the component class.</p>

<p>For example, if you inject the form control with a @ViewChild(NgForm) query and examine it in the ngAfterViewInit lifecycle hook, you'll discover that it has no children. You must trigger a change detection cycle using setTimeout() before you can extract a value from a control, test its validity, or set it to a new value.</p>

<p>The asynchrony of template-driven forms also complicates unit testing. You must wrap your test block in async() or fakeAsync() to avoid looking for values in the form that aren't there yet. With reactive forms, everything is available immediately.</p>
